# PyBer Analysis Overview
Ride sharing data from company, PyBer, was organized, sorted, and analyzed statistically according to type: "Urban", "Suburban", and "Rural". Initial analysis,performed in /PyBer.ipynb includes the following data: 
  1. Bubble chart plotting the total number of rides per city against the average fare in dollars according to city type with bubble size corresponding to the number of drivers in the city (/analysis/Fig1.png)
  2. Box plots corresponding to statistical analysis of the number of rides for each city type (/analysis/Fig2.png)
  3. Box plots corresponding to statistical analysis of the fare amounts for each city type (/analysis/Fig3.png)
  4. Box plots corresponding to statistical analysis of the number of drivers for each city type (/analysis/Fig4.png)
  5. Pie chart depicting the distribution of total fares according to city type (/analysis/Fig5.png)
  6. Pie chart depicting the distribution of total number of rides according to city type (/analysis/Fig6.png)
  7. Pie chart depicting the distribution of total number of drivers according to city type (/analysis/Fig7.png)

Upon review of initial analysis, a second analysis was performed in /PyBer_Challenge.ipynb that includes:
  1. PyBer summary dataframe that organizes ride, driver, and fare data according to city type (`/analysis/PyBer_summary_DF.png`)
  2. Multi-line chart analizing weekly fares from Jan. 2019 - Apr. 2019 according to city type (`/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png`)

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to review data from PyBer ride sharing company to assess for patterns relating to revenue and ride availability according to city type.  

### Resources
Data source: Resources/ 
<br>Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, PANDAS, Matplotlib


## Results
### City Type Summary Analysis

**Table 1: PyBer Summary**
![Pyber_summary](/analysis/PyBer_summary_DF.png "Table 1")
**Table 1.** shows total number of rides, total number of drivers, total sum of fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type for all PyBer data currently available. 



### Weekly Fare Totals Analysis

**Figure 1: PyBer Weekly Fare Totals**
![Weekly_Fares](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png "Figure 1")
**Figure 1.** shows the total weekly fares from January 2019 to April 2019 for each city type. 

  - (Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types)
  - (Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type)

## Summary
In summary, there is a clear correlation between city types and total revenue.
